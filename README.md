# Probability-Problem

Consider the following problem:

Suppose we keep rolling a die and after each roll, we write down the total sum of all previous die rolls. For example, if you roll a 5, write down 5. If you then roll a 4, write down 9, etc. Let 𝑓(𝑛) be the likelihood that the number 𝑛 is written down at some point. What is the limit of 𝑓(𝑛) as 𝑛 goes to infinity ?
